Hi! I'm Kai, a civil engineering graduate from Georgia Tech!
I am currently working as a Traffic Engineer, analyzing and designing intersections/corridors.
I want to move into CS and am actively learning!
I currently am studying in the Georgia Tech Data Science and Analytics Bootcamp and self-learning online.
In the future, I want to work as a software engineer and attempt to solve complex problems! 
I found out that challenges are difficult and annoying, but they're more interesting than an easy and simple life.
Thanks!!
